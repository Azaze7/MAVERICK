## ‚å® What is Powershell-Empire? 

* Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent that ran through Windows Powershell.
* It allowed for a user to generate attack scripts for use against other Windows machines, MacOS, or Linux subsystems.
* It is not offically maintained as of August of 2019, but a fork was used as a base for the creation of this cybersecurity excercise.

## üïπÔ∏è SteamOS Integration.

* Since Maverick was made playable on both standard computers and the Steam Deck, artwork was created so that it wouldn't look out of place next to other video games.

* It is a great source of pride that my team's GameJam Project is able to sit next to games that were part of both our childhood and adulthood.
