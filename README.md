##  What is Maverick? 

* Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent that ran through Windows Powershell.
* It allowed for a user to generate attack scripts for use against other Windows machines, MacOS, or Linux subsystems.
* It is not offically maintained as of August of 2019, but a fork was used as a base for the creation of this cybersecurity excercise.

## üéûÔ∏è Video Demonstration.

* A video demonstrating a full run of the one level we completed for our vertical slice was recorded by myself for this project.
* Since it is too big to upload here, it can be found at this link:

## üïπÔ∏è SteamOS Integration.

* Since Maverick was made playable on both standard computers and the Steam Deck, artwork was created so that it wouldn't look out of place next to other video games.

* It is a great source of pride that my team's GameJam Project is able to sit next to games that were part of both our childhood and adulthood.
* If you would like to use these artworks for your copy of MAVERICK, please look at the [SteamGridAssets](https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/tree/main/SteamGridAssets "Steam Grid Artwork") folder. :)

## The Cutting Room Floor.

* Due to the strict timing of the Game Jam, we were unable to fully complete our original vision of MAVERICK.

# Second Level & "Realistic" Artstyle.
* The original intention was for the green line level to act as a tutorial, teaching the player how the game worked since it was a "simulation".
* This tutorial took inspiration from military radar equiptment and games like Atari¬Æ BattleZone, which used simple lines and vectors for their visuals.
* After the first level was completed, a secondary level was to be loaded in with a more "realistic" artstyle and harder enemies. This level was to have fully animated water and sandy beaches, along with an additional, already completed but unused song.

* Below are some of the additional sprites we had created for it. (Every asset had a tutorial and realistic version created, though they went unused)

| | Tutorial | Realistic |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Player Character [F-14 Tomcat] | Row1     | Row1     |
| Enemy (Side-to-side) [MIG-28] | Row2     | Row2     |
| Enemy (Stationary Missle) [MIG-29] | Row3     | Row3     |
| Enemy (Divebombers) [YAK-141] | Row4     | Row4     |
| Enemy Missle     | Row5     | Row5     |

# Powerups.
* It was the team's intention that enemies that were destroyed would periodically drop powerups.
* These powerups were loosely based off the Top Gun¬© Movie, and included things like a pair of avaitor sunglasses and a volleyball.
* Their sprites and intended functions are shown below.

| | Tutorial | Realistic | Function |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Volleyball | Row1     | Row1     | Summoned an additonal jet that would fly next to yours for double firepower. (Inspired by double ships in NAMCO's Galaga.) |
| Sunglasses | Row2     | Row2     | Created a shield that would be at the front of the player's jet. This shield could be used to block enemy fire for a short while. |
| Maverick Emblem | Row3     | Row3     | Made all shots fired by the player into missles for a short while. (Design based on Konami's Contra.) |
