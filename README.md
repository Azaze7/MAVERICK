##  What is MAVERICK? What were our Design Decisions?

* Powershell-Empire was an open-source post-exploitation agent that ran through Windows Powershell.
* It allowed for a user to generate attack scripts for use against other Windows machines, MacOS, or Linux subsystems.
* It is not offically maintained as of August of 2019, but a fork was used as a base for the creation of this cybersecurity excercise.

### License Choice
* Since the prompt of this event was to choose a movie or TV show from the late 80's through early 90's to base our game off of, we started by making a list as a team of what media we enjoyed from the era.
* Some titles discussed and their potiental genre included:
| *Title* | *Genre* |
|----------|----------|
| The Evil Dead (1981) | Survival Horror |
| Indiana Jones & The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) | 2D Platformer |
| Karate Kid (1984) | Fighting Game |
| Top Gun (1986) | 2D Shooter/Bullet Hell |
| Space Balls (1987) | Ship Simulator |
| Forest Gump (1994) | Endless Runner |

* Potiental titles were struck based on their imagined difficulty to create given our tight time schedule.
* Needing a lot of unique animations for 2D fighters led to Karate Kid getting struck. 
* Needing a lot of code to make a fun simulation led to Space Balls getting struck.
* Needing a lot of unique assets led to The Evil Dead and Indiana Jones getting struck.
* Forest Gump was struck due to lack of interest, leading us to choose Top Gun.

### Naming Conventions

* Due to the rules stating that we were *NOT* allowed to directly adapt the movie, we chose to make our game a prequel to the original Top Gun Film, when the character Pete "Maverick" Mitchell was still in Flight School, using a simulator.
* The name of the game, MAVERICK, was chosen to satirize the wierd naming conventions that are tied to movie franchises like Rocky and Rambo. (Such as Rocky 6 being called "Rocky Balboa" and Rambo 4 being called just "Rambo").
* The flow of our Game has a fun flow now too, being:
* MAVERICK -> Top Gun -> Top Gun: Maverick.

### Cabinet Design
* Since MAVERICK takes design inspiration from retro arcade games, we decided to copy the way that those games are played now.
* Emulated collections of arcade games are usually played on modern TVs or monitors, which are much wider than the arcades of old.
* We decided to add side art as though MAVERICK was a real arcade game when it is in play, which you may have seen in retro collections such as NAMCO Musuem.

### A 2-level Approach.
* In order to teach players who may have never played a 2D shooter, the first level was set to be a tutorial with basic graphics. The colors are purposely kept simple with vectors to tie into our plot of Maverick still being in Flight School.
* After the first level is completed, the difficulty was to be increased and a more impressive presentation would also follow.
* We were only trying to do a 2 level vertical slice due to the strict time constraints.

### Healthbar & Difficulty.
* In order to ensure MAVERICK was able to be completed by everyone who played it on the show floor, we took a more "modern-day approach" to the game's difficulty.
* While MAVERICK did take a ton of inspiration from retro arcade style shooters, we did not want it to feel like it was designed to take your quarters away, nor overly frustrating to even a novice gamer.
* To accomplish this, we removed the concept of lives so that everyone could just play the game, and respawn after a short while when they died. We did NOT want anyone to reach a GAME OVER state early. (This concept is implemented in many modern games, such as Celeste or Super Mario Odyssey).
* We also increased the number of hit points the player ship could take for the sake of the demo. It was increased from 5 to 25, which in practice made it almost impossible for anyone to even see their ship blow up, especially since this was originally a tutorial stage.
* We had very few people die while playing MAVERICK on the show floor, and when they did they respawned very quickly to keep the game fun.
* *If MAVERICK was to be retooled, rebranded, and then released as a proper videogame, the hitpoints would be decreased to a more "challenging" level.*

## 🎞️ Video Demonstration.

* A video demonstrating a full run of the one level we completed for our vertical slice was recorded by myself for this project.
* Since it is too big to upload here, it can be found at this link:
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJutJYl7XlY 

## 🕹️ SteamOS Integration.

* Since Maverick was made playable on both standard computers and the Steam Deck, artwork was created so that it wouldn't look out of place next to other video games.

<p align="center">

* It is a great source of pride that my team's GameJam Project is able to sit next to games that were part of both our childhood and adulthood.
* If you would like to use these artworks for your copy of MAVERICK, please look at the [SteamGridAssets](https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/tree/main/SteamGridAssets "Steam Grid Artwork") folder. :)

## ✂️ The Cutting Room Floor.

* Due to the strict timing of the Game Jam, we were unable to fully complete our original vision of MAVERICK.

### Second Level & "Realistic" Artstyle.
* The original intention was for the green line level to act as a tutorial, teaching the player how the game worked since it was a "simulation".
* This tutorial took inspiration from military radar equiptment and games like Atari® BattleZone, which used simple lines and vectors for their visuals.
* After the first level was completed, a secondary level was to be loaded in with a more "realistic" artstyle and harder enemies. This level was to have fully animated water and sandy beaches, along with an additional, already completed but unused song.

* Below are some of the additional sprites we had created for it. Keep in mind, in our code every single sprite had the same hitbox regardless if it was in the tutorial or real version of the level.
* (Every asset we created had a tutorial and realistic version created, though they went unused.)

| | Tutorial | Realistic |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Player Character [F-14 Tomcat] | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/Tutorial_Ship_Player.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/F-14_Tomcat_Player.png" > |
| Enemy (Side-to-side) [MIG-28] | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MIG-28_Tutorial_Ship_Enemy.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MIG-28_Enemy.png" > |
| Enemy (Stationary Missle) [MIG-29] | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MIG-29_Tutorial_Ship_Enemy.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MIG-29_Enemy.png" > |
| Enemy (Divebombers) [YAK-141] | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/YAK-141_Tutorial_Ship_Enemy.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/YAK-141_Enemy.png" > |
| Enemy Missle     | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/Enemy_Missile_Tutorial.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/Enemy_Missile_Real.png" > |

### Powerups.
* It was the team's intention that enemies that were destroyed would periodically drop powerups.
* These powerups were loosely based off the Top Gun© Movie, and included things like a pair of avaitor sunglasses and a volleyball.
* Their sprites and intended functions are shown below.

| | Tutorial | Realistic | Function |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Volleyball | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/Volleyball_Tutorial.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/Volleyball_real.png" > | Summoned an additonal jet that would fly next to yours for double firepower. (Inspired by double ships in NAMCO's Galaga.) |
| Sunglasses | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/sunglasses_Tutorial.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/sunglasses_real.png" > | Created a shield that would be at the front of the player's jet. This shield could be used to block enemy fire for a short while. |
| Maverick Emblem | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MaverickEmblem_Tutorial.png" > | <img src="https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/blob/main/SpriteComparisonAssets/MaverickEmblem_Real.png" > | Made all shots fired by the player into missles for a short while. (Design based powerups in Konami's Contra.) |
