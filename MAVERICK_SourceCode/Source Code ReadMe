**There were 6 files that were too big to upload to github, even with Git LFS.**

They (and the rest of the source code, can be found here, on my Google Drive:

If you want to just get everything that made MAVERICK what it is, simply download it from the google drive. All Necessary Files to compile it through Unity will be there too :)
