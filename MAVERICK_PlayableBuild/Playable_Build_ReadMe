**You still require one more asset file to play MAVERICK, that is too big to upload here even with Git LFS.**

It can be found here, on my Google Drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KB6mFCfyyVCkV2cwvvjQneqYd6TaGkw9/view?usp=sharing

It is named "sharedassets2.resource"! Just place it in the MAVERICK_PlayableBuild File and then start 'Maverick.exe'.

If you want to just get it ready to go, simply download it from the google drive. All Necessary Files will be there too :)
